## General Information
- This assignment is a programming assignment.
- We have to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables
- It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.
- Business can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
- Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market


## Conclusions
- The model will be used to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.
- Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes.
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands



## Technologies Used
- Jupier notebook 6.5.4( Anaconda navigator 2.4.3 suit)
- Python 3
- Python libraries like Numpy, Padnas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Windows 10
- CSV Dataset
